## Study purpose and method

 
- As documented in Geography of Jobs, the NYC metro has experienced particular post-recession shifts in its growth pattern as the region centralizes, resulting in central urban areas and NYC in particular bearing larger portions of population, housing and employment growth than in previous periods.
- The purpose of this study is to contextualize NYC Metro experience within the larger context of US metros, to compare our growth patterns to other comparable metros both as potential competitors for economic growth and as exemplars of consistent regional centralization patterns.
- We ask 3 main questions:
  - How does NYC metro growth of jobs, workforce and housing compare to other major metro regions? Are we growing faster or slower than other comparable regions?
  - How relatively well is our housing production keeping pace with economic growth? Are other regions doing a better or worse job of producing new housing relative to population and economic growth?
  - How much do intra-regional shifts between urban center and suburbs account for outcomes in different regions? Are all regions seeing their central cities playing an increasingly outsized role in economic and population growth?
 

## Existing conditions

- NY Metro is largest pop in U.S – about 1.2x L.A., 2.5x Chicago or DC, 3x SF, Boston
- Economy is largest in US – about 1.4x LA, 2.3x Chicago, 2.5x SF.
- NYC has largest agglomerations of office based and institutional (healthcare and university) employment
- Housing stock similarly larger, has high renter composition (2nd to LA)
- NY Metro workforce has a similar age composition to other large metros
- NYC is a larger component of the region than other cities are of their regions.
- NY Metro has more land area at higher population and employment densities than any other metro.
 

## What’s changing at the metro scale?

### NY is the largest metro, but it’s also growing slowly.** 
  - The NY Metro growing slower than many other large metros – in absolute terms (less pop add than LA, Dallas, Houston) and % terms (slower than every large metro except Chicago, Phila, Detroit).
  - As result, NY Metro share of US pop is decreasing slowly over time
### Our economy is still the largest and biggest winner, but we are not alone in metro economic success. 
  - NYC Metro added just about million jobs post 2010 – about 1.6%/yr.
  - LA gained almost equivalent # of jobs
  - Growth rate about equivalent to Boston metro – Chicago, DC, Phila lower
  - Office gains more in SF, nearly met by Dallas, but much faster growth in other locations
  - Institution gains high but outpaced by LA
  - Services gains more than any other metro
  - Industrial losses vs. small gains in SF, Denver (not LA)
 
### Our workforce is aging, and other smaller metros are substantially growing their young workforce.
 - NYC is 11th of 15 metros in rate of labor force growth – added 1.5M workers since 2000 but at rate slightly less than US average (just under 1%/year)
 - 75% of labor force growth was in workers 55+. In absolute terms, growth in prime-age labor force was smaller than LA, DC, Dallas, Houston, Miami. Higher than SF, Atlanta, Seattle, Denver. (growth at aprox .38%/year)
 - As a result, a larger proportion of our working age population is older – as older workers age out of working, our ability to replenish our talent base affects our ability to grow jobs (THIS POINT NEEDS CLEARER DATA ON OVERALL % OF AGING WORKFORCE)
 
### NYC Metro has one of the lowest rates of Housing growth of all metros.
 - At about .3% a year permitted (and less actually built), the growth of our metro’s housing stock is only faster than Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit, which have not experienced the same economic success.
 - In the post-recession period, we added housing at only about .5 units for every 1 job. (NEED TO KNOW HOW OTHER METROS DID IN THIS TIME SCALE).
 - Over a 20 year period, the rate isn’t as bad – about 1 home per job. Still a slower rate of housing growth relative to job growth than most metros.  
 - Though low on overall housing growth, NY Metro still had the largest supply of new multifamily housing. All regions saw a decline in single family unit production post-recession, while multifamily production remained relatively constant across cities.
 
### Though low on overall housing growth, NY Metro still had the largest supply of new multifamily housing.
 - All regions saw a decline in single family unit production post-recession, while multifamily production remained relatively constant across cities.
 - NYC’s high share of multifamily production is what buoyed its overall supply post-recession – once single family declined, regions with largest multifamily potential fared best in overall production.
 

## Changing relationship of city/suburbs

- **NYC itself is growing at about US average – but suburbs have slowed.** NYC is growing at a similar rate to LA. But LA suburbs are growing twice as fast as NYC suburbs. NYC growing at 2.3x suburbs.
- **Most central cities are experiencing faster growth than rest of metro but the extent is mixed.** NYC, DC, Boston and Philadelphia (old NE cities) all had central cities growing over 2x the rate of the suburbs. Seattle approached 2:1, but most other cities grew a 1-1.5 times the suburban rates. Only in Dallas and Houston are the suburbs continuing to outpace central city population growth.
- Another consideration is the central cities’ growth relative to its historic contribution to population. NYC is 37% of metro pop, but 57% of post-recession, pop growth – in other words,
NYC’s pop growth concentrated at a rate 1.6x its historic share. Similarly, the old NE cities of Boston (2.39x) Philadelphia (1.82x), DC (1.85x) saw the most accentuated center city population concentration. Conversely, these areas saw once population attracting suburban areas contributing less to overall regional population growth than historic patterns would suggest – while western cities saw more evenly spread growth, and the Texas cities further deconcentrated population from their central cities.
